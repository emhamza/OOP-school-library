# 📖 OOP school library <a name="about-project"></a>

The "OOP school library" app is a tool designed for librarians at OOP University. The app allows librarians to manage the library's collection of books and keep track of who borrows them. It provides the following functionalities: adding new students or teachers, adding new books, and recording borrowing records. The app is built using Object-Oriented Programming principles and follows a UML class diagram. It also includes a console-based user interface for interaction. Throughout the development process, there are multiple projects that guide the implementation of different features, such as creating person classes, utilizing the decorator design pattern, establishing associations, implementing a basic UI, refactoring code, preserving data, and performing unit tests.
